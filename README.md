# Advent of Code 2021

I don't know why you are looking at this currently.

This repo contains my clerk "notebooks" for AOC 2021.

I am doing this for fun and only upload it here as for safekeeping.

Clerk static build notebooks can be accessed through GitHub Pages at: <https://aardvark.github.io/aoc-2021-clojure/>
